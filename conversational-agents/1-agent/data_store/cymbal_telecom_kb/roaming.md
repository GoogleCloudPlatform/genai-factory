## Roaming Terms and Conditions

The following terms and conditions apply to all Cymbal Telecom roaming services, ensuring fair usage and transparent billing for our customers. These terms are general and may be superseded by specific promotional offers or package terms if applicable.

### 1. Activation and Eligibility

*   **Automatic Activation**: For most post-paid Cymbal Telecom subscribers, international roaming services are automatically activated prior to travel.
*   **Pre-paid Services**: Pre-paid customers must ensure they have a sufficient balance to cover roaming charges. Activation may require a one-time request through the **MyCymbal App** or by contacting customer support before international travel.
*   **Credit Limit**: Standard credit limits apply to roaming usage. Excessive roaming usage, or accumulated charges exceeding a predefined threshold, may lead to a temporary suspension of services or require a security deposit.

### 2. Billing and Charges

*   **Per-Unit Billing**: Charges are applied based on the per-minute, per-SMS, and per-MB rates outlined in the "Roaming Coverage and Costs" table above.
*   **Voice Call Charges**:
    *   **Outgoing Calls**: Both calls made to numbers within the visited country and calls made back to your home country (Cymbal Telecom network) are charged at the applicable "Voice (per min)" rate. Outgoing international calls to other countries may incur higher, specific international roaming rates.
    *   **Incoming Calls**: Receiving calls while roaming is also charged at the applicable "Voice (per min)" rate.
*   **Data Billing**: Data usage is rounded up to the nearest Kilobyte (KB). Customers should be advised that data consumption can increase rapidly with streaming, automatic app updates, and background app usage.
*   **SMS Billing**: Sending SMS messages is charged per message. While receiving standard SMS messages is typically free, receiving premium SMS (e.g., subscription services) may incur charges.
*   **Billing Cycle**: All roaming charges will be itemized and applied to your next monthly statement.
*   **Currency**: All stated charges are in **United States Dollars (USD)**. For customers whose home currency is different, charges will be converted at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of billing.

### 3. Fair Usage Policy (FUP)

*   **Purpose**: Cymbal Telecom's FUP is designed to ensure fair access to network resources for all users and prevent misuse of roaming services.
*   **Data Speeds**: While Cymbal Telecom strives to provide the best possible data experience, roaming data speeds are dependent on the local network infrastructure in the visited country and may vary significantly. In some regions, data speeds may be throttled after a certain data threshold is exceeded to manage network resources and prevent unreasonable consumption patterns. This is generally a speed reduction, not a complete service cut-off.
*   **Prohibited Use**: Roaming services are intended for periodic travel and not for continuous, prolonged use in a roaming country as a substitute for a local telecommunications service. Prolonged domestic use of roaming services may lead to an account review and potential service termination.

### 4. Service Limitations and Exclusions

*   **Coverage**: International roaming coverage is dependent on agreements with local network operators. In certain remote or less developed areas within a listed country, service may be limited or unavailable.
*   **Special Numbers**: Calls to special numbers (e.g., premium rate numbers, certain toll-free numbers, short codes) may have different charges or may not be accessible while roaming. Customers should be advised to familiarize themselves with local emergency numbers (e.g., 911, 112, 999) beforehand, as these typically remain accessible.
*   **Wi-Fi Calling Caution**: While Wi-Fi Calling often uses your domestic plan's rates when connected to a Wi-Fi network, customers should be advised to **disable mobile data** if they wish to avoid any potential roaming data charges, especially if connecting to public Wi-Fi networks that might redirect data traffic through the mobile network.
*   **Maritime/Satellite/In-flight Roaming**: Standard roaming services *do not* cover usage on cruise ships, ferries, aircraft, or satellite networks. These environments operate on separate, significantly higher rate structures, and specific packages (e.g., *Cymbal Maritime Connect*) would be required for such services.

### 5. Customer Support While Roaming

*   **General Support**: Customers can dial `+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX` (standard international calling rates apply) or use the **MyCymbal App** via Wi-Fi to contact customer support.
*   **Emergency Services**: In case of emergency, customers should always dial the local emergency number for the country they are in.
*   **Lost/Stolen Device**: Advise customers to immediately report a lost or stolen device to Cymbal Telecom support to prevent unauthorized usage and fraudulent charges.

### 6. Changes to Terms & Conditions

Cymbal Telecom reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions, roaming rates, or coverage areas at any time. Customers will be notified of significant changes via the **MyCymbal App**, email, or other appropriate communication channels.
